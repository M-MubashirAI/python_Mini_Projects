# Object-Oriented Calculator in Python

## 📌 Overview
This is a simple yet powerful **Object-Oriented Calculator** implemented in Python. The calculator follows the principles of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, including **encapsulation, inheritance, and method-based operations**. It supports basic arithmetic operations and an advanced power function.

## 🔥 Features
- **Addition** (`+`)
- **Subtraction** (`-`)
- **Multiplication** (`×`)
- **Division** (`÷`) _(with exception handling for division by zero)_
- **Exponentiation** (`a^b`)
- **User-friendly menu** for selecting operations
- **Error handling** for invalid inputs

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts
- **Exception Handling**

## 🏗 Project Structure
```
|-- calculator.py  # Main Python file with OOP implementation
|-- README.md      # Project documentation
```

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the `calculator.py` file.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to perform calculations.

## 📖 Usage
- Run the program and select an operation by entering a number (1-6).
- Enter two numbers as input.
- The calculator will display the result and ask if you want to continue.
- To exit, select option **6** or type "no" when prompted.

## ✨ Example Output
```
====================================
==== Object-Oriented Calculator ====
1. Add
2. Subtract
3. Multiply
4. Divide
5. Power (a^b)
6. Exit
====================================
Enter your choice (1-6): 3
Enter first number: 5
Enter second number: 2
Result: 5 × 2 = 10
Do you want to perform further calculations? (yes/no): no
